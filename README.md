The tool was made to support any render-engine but right now only `Redshift`, `3Delight` and `Arnold` 
are supported, with the last two having limited render-engine texture baking features. This could be
improved in the future if I get some help.

Else you can follow the guide on the documentation  to add or customize your render-engine support.
